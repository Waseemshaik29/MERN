The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila in Hindi, is a historic fort located in the city of Delhi, India. Here's a brief overview of its history:</h3>
    <h3>1.Architectural Style: </h3> <h3>The Red Fort is an excellent example of Mughal architecture, blending Persian, Timurid, and Indian architectural styles. The fort is made of red sandstone, which gives it its distinctive color. It features massive walls, bastions, and intricate marble inlay work, reflecting the grandeur and opulence of the Mughal empire.</h3>
    <h3>2.Historical Significance:</h3> <h3> The Red Fort served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years, from its completion in 1648 until the British East India Company seized control of Delhi in 1857 during the Indian Rebellion. It was the center of political power and ceremonial events, where the emperor would receive dignitaries, hold court, and celebrate important festivals such as Eid and Diwali.</h3>
