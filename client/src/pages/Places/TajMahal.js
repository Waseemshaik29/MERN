    The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, India, is one of the most famous and recognizable landmarks in the world. Here's a brief overview of its history:</h3>
    <h3>1.Completion and Legacy:</h3> <h3>The Taj Mahal was completed in 1653, and Mumtaz Mahal's body was interred in the mausoleum. Shah Jahan was also later buried beside her after his death. The Taj Mahal has since become a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is considered one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It attracts millions of visitors each year and remains an enduring symbol of India's rich cultural heritage.</h3>
    <h3>2.Construction:</h3> <h3>  Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and lasted for around 22 years, employing thousands of artisans, craftsmen, and laborers. The main architect of the Taj Mahal is believed to be Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, although several other architects and craftsmen also contributed to its construction.</h3>
